# Covid Risk Map

## Motivation
Give a feel for how dangerous it can be to venture outside when the COVID pandemic is still at large. Practicing social distancing, wearing face masks, and constantly washing hands can be ways to slow down the virus, but is not as effective as simply staying at home. If you do need to go outside, going to open, loosely populated areas such as a golf field would be ideal. Heavily populated areas such as bars or buffets would have a higher chance of getting Coronavirus.

## Technologies
- Xcode 11.3
- Swift 5
- Tested on iPhone X iOS 13.3

## How to Play
Tap on the buildings to see approximately how much risk there is in visitng them. Shake the device to simulate washing your hands. The large counter under the emoji will display your risk level. Reset the counter with the button in the bottom right. 

The CDC logo will redirect you to the CDC website.
